 # SimpleCalculator
  
 Basic Java Program: 
 
  I created this program for fun in my early years of learning java. I wanted to create a basic calculator, and I did just that here. 
  When I wrote the code, I didn't have a solid understanding of time complexity, space complexity, or design stategies so the code 
  doesn't reflect that knowledge. Some design stategies would certainly make this code look and read a lot nicer, and it may also 
  allow for easier additions onto the calculator.
